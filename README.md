## 🤖 AI Tools Used

### Claude (claude.ai / Anthropic)
Used **Claude Sonnet** as the primary development assistant throughout this project.

**How it was used:**
- **Architecture planning** — Claude suggested the widget decomposition (`SpendHeaderCard`, `CategoryScroll`, `TransactionTile`) based on the assignment brief
- **Design direction** — Asked Claude to recommend a color palette and typography pairing for a premium fintech dark-mode UI; it proposed the deep violet `#0F0E17` background + electric cyan `#00E5C9` accent combination
- **Code generation** — Generated initial implementations for each widget, which I reviewed, adjusted for Flutter specifics (API compatibility, layout tweaks), and refined
- **Mock data** — Claude generated the 57 realistic Indian transaction entries with varied merchants, categories, and amounts
- **fl_chart sparkline** — Claude provided the `LineChart` configuration for the 15-day spend sparkline in the header card
- **Animation stagger** — Suggested `flutter_animate` for the entrance animations and the stagger pattern for list items

**My contributions on top of AI output:**
- Adjusted layout constraints and padding for pixel-perfect spacing
- Tuned gradient stops and opacity values by visual inspection
- Restructured the grouped-by-date list logic from a flat `ListView` to a proper `CustomScrollView` with multiple `SliverList`s
- Added the `_showElevation` scroll listener for the AppBar shadow
- Tested and fixed the `fl_chart` data mapping (dividing amounts by 1000 to normalise the y-axis)

**Time taken:** ~2.5 hours

## 🎨 Design Decisions

1. **Dark violet palette** — Fintech apps look premium in dark mode. Chose `#0F0E17` (near-black with a violet tint) over flat black to feel warm rather than sterile.
2. **Gradient hero card** — The monthly spend card uses a 3-stop `violet → indigo → cyan` gradient as the visual anchor. Everything else is quiet.
3. **Inter typeface** — Neutral, high-legibility, widely used in fintech. The `fontWeight: w800` + `letterSpacing: -2` pairing on the amount creates a display-style number that reads fast.
4. **Electric cyan accent (`#00E5C9`)** — Used for Travel category and secondary highlights. Contrasts clearly against the violet without clashing.
5. **Staggered animations** — Each section fades and slides in 100ms after the previous, guiding the eye top-to-bottom through the hierarchy.
